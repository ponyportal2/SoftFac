# SoftFac TODO

Living plan. Rewrite freely as the design becomes clearer.

## What SoftFac is

A Pi-native software factory:
- An **implementer** Pi session works one GitHub issue at a time on a branch.
- A **reviewer** Pi session is continuous per issue area (bug, feature, ...) and approves or
  requests changes.
- An **architect** Pi session reviews the cumulative change on a cadence (every N commits)
  and always for substantial issues.
- Bugs are auto-merged and auto-closed after review, but only when the live PR passes the same
  policy check CI runs; a failed check blocks the issue instead of merging.
- Substantial changes land in the human approval pile (`softfac:needs-human`).
- A GitHub Action enforces the PR policy and reopens an issue closed by a non-compliant PR.

## Current state (2026-10-24)

- [x] Core pipeline: claim -> implement -> review loop -> architecture gate -> PR -> merge/close.
- [x] Config parsing, labels, init scaffolding, doctor, check-pr, GitHub Action.
- [x] File state store with atomic writes; sessions persisted across restarts.
- [x] Architecture reviews anchored to the base branch (squash-merge safe) with persisted
      decisions fed back to the architect.
- [x] Factory-level TDD gate for bug fixes.
- [x] Non-destructive label sync and README documentation.
- [x] Base branch sync before each issue: fetch + fast-forward, skipped (with a warning) when
      the local base has diverged or the tree is dirty. Covered by a real bare-remote test.
- [x] Crash recovery: in-flight issues are requeued on the first cycle, and PR creation reuses
      an open PR for the branch instead of duplicating it.
- [x] Worktrees are released as soon as an issue finishes (success, block, or failure), and
      `softfac status` renders state without opening the JSON file.
- [x] PR bodies no longer claim a test/typecheck pass that never ran.
- [x] `softfac doctor` verifies that the working directory is a git repo with an `origin` remote.
- [x] Verification commands: `verification.commands` run sequentially in the issue's sandbox
      before the PR opens, stop at the first failure, and block the issue with the exit code and
      the tail of the output. The PR body records what passed.
- [x] Agent verdicts are validated with zod schemas; missing `findings`/`followUps` default
      to an empty list.
- [x] The architecture diff is capped at `architecture.maxDiffChars` (default 60k) with an
      explicit truncation marker in the prompt.
- [x] Merge gate: before a bug is auto-merged, the factory runs `check-pr`'s policy against the
      live PR. A violation or a failed check blocks the issue and leaves the PR open.
- [x] Architecture follow-ups become `softfac:follow-up` issues, deduplicated against the
      retained decision history; a failed issue creation only logs a warning.
- [x] The architect receives a repository context: changed files, module inventory, architecture
      documents, dependency manifests, and coverage report paths, in addition to the capped diff.
- [x] `check-pr --repair` reopens an issue that a non-compliant PR closed; the bundled Action
      runs it with `issues: write`.
- [x] Daemon hygiene: single-instance lock with stale-lock recovery, `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` stop
      after the current cycle, and exponential backoff with jitter on failed cycles.
- [x] Reviewer sessions are keyed by issue area (`reviewer:bug`, `reviewer:feature`, ...)
      instead of one immortal session for the whole repository.
- [x] Reusing an open PR after a crash refreshes its title and body with `gh pr edit`.
- [x] Human PR feedback: while an issue waits in the human pile, each cycle polls its PR for
      comments and change-request reviews, hands them to the implementer, re-reviews, verifies,
      and pushes. Handled ids live on the issue record, so a comment is never implemented twice.
- [x] An interrupted feedback run recovers to `pull-request` and re-polls the PR instead of
      requeueing the issue as fresh work.
- [x] `softfac status` and the architect prompt show the issue filed for each follow-up
      (`filed as #N`), persisted on the decision record.
- [x] Follow-up triage decided: no automatic promotion. The label is informational and a human
      adds `softfac:ready` to the follow-ups worth doing, so the factory cannot feed itself.
- [x] The architect reads the contents of the five newest decision documents (numbered ADRs
      first, review notes excluded, 4,000 characters each) instead of only their paths.
- [x] 221 tests, typecheck clean, `npm run build` clean.

## Next (pick up here)

Nothing queued. Candidates from the ideas list, roughly in value order:

1. Per-area reviewer prompts (a bug reviewer cares about regression tests; a feature reviewer
   about design).
2. Cost/token accounting per issue from Pi's session metadata.

## Ideas / not scheduled

- Per-area round limits.
- A `softfac follow-ups` command that lists the open follow-up pile.

## Known limitations

- Every new human comment on a waiting PR is treated as a change request, so a non-actionable
  comment still starts a feedback round.
- A feedback round does not re-run the architecture gate; the issue already passed it and a
  human merges the result.
- The architect sees the diff plus a repository outline, not the whole repository.
- Reviewer sessions are reused per area, so a very long-lived session can still drift.
